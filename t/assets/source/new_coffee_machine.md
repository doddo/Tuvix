I just got a brand new coffee machine installed the other day and it does make a good cup of coffe.

By the way, there is a difference in strength between how swedes do coffee compared to the america and or other regions or so:

Google says that there's 40 mg caffeine per 100ml, but svenska livsmedelsverket put the caffeine at 66,6666667 mg.

 I bet that the coffee which comes out of my machine is even stronger than that because I can't stand blaskigt kaffe. (I approximate it to round about 80 mg)

This could be a good subject for a PhD in social science or something.
