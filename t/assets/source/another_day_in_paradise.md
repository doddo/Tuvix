Did you know that “Another day in paradise” by Phil Collins does have a hidden meaning in it: While the title seems to hint at something very positive, one could think that it was a song to praise the gift of life, and what a treasure it is, but then you start listening to the lyrics and uncover a different meaning hidden underneth:


> She calls out to the man on the street He can see she’s been crying</p>


heavy stuff.

At any rate it’s a fantastic song, a true classic.
